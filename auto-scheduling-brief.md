# Feature Brief: Auto-Scheduling System

**To:** Algorithm & Programming Expert
**From:** [Your Name/Company Name]
**Date:** 2025-08-10
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

We are looking to develop an advanced auto-scheduling system for our lesson management platform. The goal is to automate the creation of semester timetables based on student and teacher availability, solving a complex scheduling problem with a high-quality, optimized solution.

This document outlines the required features and constraints to guide your research and proposal for the best algorithmic approach.

## 2. Project Goal

To design and implement a robust and efficient auto-scheduling engine that can generate an optimal semester timetable based on a set of constraints. The system should be able to handle complex scenarios and provide a high-quality schedule that minimizes conflicts and maximizes teacher and student satisfaction.

## 3. Core Requirements

### 3.1. Inputs

- **Student Availability:** A list of time slots for each student, indicating when they are available for lessons.
  - **Format:** "Mon 2-3pm, Tue 2-4pm, Wed 5-6pm"
- **Teacher Availability:** A set of configurable time windows during which the teacher is available to give lessons.
- **Lesson Duration:** The duration of each lesson (e.g., 30, 45, 60 minutes). This can be fixed for all students or variable per student.
- Both student and teacher availability are set the same every week for a whole semester.

### 3.2. Core Engine

- **Constraint Satisfaction:** The core of the system should be a constraint satisfaction engine that can handle various scheduling constraints, including:
  - A student can only be in one lesson at a time.
  - A teacher can only teach one lesson at a time.
  - Lessons must be scheduled within the teacher's availability.
  - Lessons must be scheduled within the student's availability.
- **Optimization:** The engine should be optimized to find the best possible schedule based on a set of criteria, such as:
  - Minimizing gaps between lessons for the teacher.
  - Maximizing the number of scheduled lessons.
  - Prioritizing certain students or lessons.
- **Conflict Resolution:** The system must intelligently handle scheduling conflicts. If a perfect schedule is not possible, it should provide alternative solutions or highlight the conflicts that need manual resolution.
- **AI/Machine Learning (Optional but desired):** We are interested in exploring the use of AI or machine learning to improve schedule quality over time, by learning from past schedules and user feedback.

### 3.3. Outputs

- **Optimal Timetable:** The primary output should be a fully optimized semester timetable for the teacher.
- **Alternative Schedules:** If multiple optimal schedules are found, the system could propose a few alternatives.
- **Conflict Report:** A report detailing any unresolved conflicts.

## 4. User Interaction Flow

While the core of your work will be on the scheduling algorithm, it's helpful to understand the user interaction flow:

1.  **Data Collection:** The teacher sends a form to parents/students to collect their availability for the upcoming semester.
2.  **Manual Input:** The teacher can manually input or override availability for students who don't respond.
3.  **Scheduling Trigger:** Once all availability is collected, the teacher triggers the auto-scheduling process.
4.  **Review and Approve:** The system presents the generated schedule to the teacher for review and approval.
5.  **Finalization:** The teacher finalizes the schedule, which is then communicated to the students.

## 5. Deliverables

We expect you to research and propose three distinct strategies to tackle this auto-scheduling problem. You are encouraged to use any resources at your disposal, including websites, GitHub repositories, and technical or scientific papers.

Your proposal should detail the following three paths:

1.  **A purely algorithmic approach:**
    - **Description:** A detailed description of the proposed algorithm(s) (e.g., Constraint Programming, Genetic Algorithms, etc.).
    - **Implementation Notes:** This solution would need to be implemented in **PHP**. Please consider the limitations of this environment, particularly regarding processing power and the lack of simple concurrency.
2.  **A purely AI-driven approach:**
    - **Description:** A strategy centered on using AI models (e.g., LLMs) for the entire scheduling process, including prompt and context engineering.
3.  **A hybrid approach:**
    - **Description:** A solution that combines both algorithms and AI. Examples include:
      - An algorithm generates an initial schedule, and AI is used to resolve conflicts or optimize it further.
      - AI generates a schedule, and an algorithm verifies its correctness and constraints.

For each of the three paths, please provide:

- **Pros and Cons:** A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses in the context of our requirements.
- **Implementation Plan:** A high-level plan for implementation, including technology stack recommendations.
- **Scalability and Performance:** An analysis of the expected performance and scalability.
- **Proof of Concept (Optional):** A simple proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

## 6. Success Metrics

The success of this project will be measured by:

- **Schedule Quality:** The ability to generate high-quality, conflict-free schedules.
- **Performance:** The time it takes to generate a schedule for a given number of students and constraints.
- **Scalability:** The ability to handle a growing number of students and more complex scheduling scenarios.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** An analysis of the potential costs associated with each approach (e.g., development time, API costs for AI solutions).

We look forward to your proposals and are excited to work with you on this challenging and rewarding project.
