# Deployment Blocking Strategy - Complete Implementation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment blocking implementation for the Eleno project, ensuring no broken deployments reach production or staging environments.

## üéØ Overview

Our deployment blocking strategy prevents deployments when tests fail, providing:
- **Zero broken deployments** to production and staging
- **Comprehensive test validation** before deployment
- **Emergency bypass procedures** for critical situations
- **Complete audit trail** of all deployments
- **Automated health monitoring** and alerting

## üèó Architecture

### Deployment Flow
```
Code Push ‚Üí Tests Run ‚Üí Tests Pass? ‚Üí Deploy
                   ‚Üì
             Tests Fail ‚Üí Block Deployment
                   ‚Üì
              Emergency? ‚Üí Manual Approval ‚Üí Emergency Deploy
```

### Key Components

1. **Test-Dependent Deployments**: All deployments wait for test success
2. **Emergency Deployment Workflow**: Break-glass procedure with approvals
3. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of deployed applications
4. **Branch Protection Rules**: GitHub-level enforcement of test requirements
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all deployment decisions

## üîß Configuration Requirements

### 1. GitHub Branch Protection Rules

#### Main Branch (Production)
```
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging  
‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1 minimum)
‚úÖ Include administrators in restrictions
‚ùå Allow force pushes
‚ùå Allow deletions

Required Status Checks:
- unit-tests (üß™ Unit Tests)
- build-tests (üî® Build Tests)  
- e2e-tests (üé≠ E2E Tests) - Optional but recommended
- subscription-tests (üí≥ Subscription Tests)
- php-tests (üß™ PHP Tests & Analysis) - For API changes
```

#### Dev Branch (Staging)
```
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
‚ùå Require pull request reviews (optional for dev)

Required Status Checks:
- unit-tests
- build-tests
- php-tests (for API changes)
```

### 2. GitHub Environment Protection

#### Production Environments (`app.production`, `api.production`)
```
‚úÖ Required reviewers: 1-2 senior developers
‚úÖ Deployment branches: main only
‚úÖ Wait timer: 0 minutes (immediate after approval)
```

#### Staging Environments (`app.staging`, `api.staging`)
```
‚ùå Required reviewers: None (for faster iteration)
‚úÖ Deployment branches: dev only
‚úÖ Wait timer: 0 minutes
```

#### Emergency Environment (`emergency-deployment`)
```
‚úÖ Required reviewers: 2 senior developers (minimum)
‚úÖ Deployment branches: Any (for emergency rollbacks)
‚úÖ Wait timer: 5 minutes (cooling-off period)
```

### 3. Required Secrets

Ensure these secrets are configured in each environment:

#### Application Secrets
- `VITE_API_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`  
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_ID_*`
- `FTP_SERVER`, `FTP_USERNAME`, `FTP_PASSWORD`

#### API Secrets
- `SUPABASE_*` (URL, keys, database credentials)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_SIGNATURE`
- `SMTP_*` (email configuration)
- `FTP_API_SERVER`, `FTP_API_USERNAME`, `FTP_API_PASSWORD`

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Normal Deployment Flow

1. **Developer pushes code** to `dev` or `main` branch
2. **Tests automatically trigger** via GitHub Actions
3. **Deployment waits** for test completion
4. **Tests pass**: Deployment proceeds automatically
5. **Tests fail**: Deployment is blocked, notification sent
6. **Health check** runs after deployment
7. **Status tracking** updates deployment dashboard

### Emergency Deployment Flow

1. **Trigger emergency workflow** via GitHub Actions UI
2. **Provide justification** and select target environment
3. **Manual approval required** from designated reviewers
4. **Optional test execution** (can be skipped for critical fixes)
5. **Deploy with audit trail** - all actions logged
6. **Post-deployment follow-up** procedures documented

## üß™ Test Requirements

### Frontend Tests (JavaScript/TypeScript)
```bash
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript compilation
npm run test         # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:cov     # Coverage validation (80% minimum)
npm run build        # Production build validation
npm run pw           # Playwright E2E tests (optional for staging)
npm run pw:subs      # Subscription flow tests (critical)
```

### Backend Tests (PHP)
```bash
composer phpcs       # Code style validation
composer stan        # PHPStan static analysis
composer test        # Pest unit tests
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Overall Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Critical Paths**: 90% minimum (subscription flows, payment processing)
- **New Code**: 85% minimum coverage for changed files

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### When to Use Emergency Deployment

Use emergency deployment ONLY for:
- **Security vulnerabilities** requiring immediate patching
- **Critical production bugs** affecting all users
- **Data corruption** or loss prevention
- **Service outages** requiring immediate rollback

### Emergency Deployment Steps

1. **Access GitHub Actions** on the repository
2. **Select "Emergency Deployment" workflow**
3. **Fill out the form**:
   - Select deployment target
   - Provide detailed justification
   - Choose whether to skip tests
   - Specify rollback commit if needed
4. **Submit for approval** - requires manual approval from designated reviewers
5. **Monitor deployment** closely during and after completion
6. **Follow up immediately** with proper fix and regular deployment

### Post-Emergency Checklist

After any emergency deployment:
- [ ] Monitor application health for at least 1 hour
- [ ] Check error rates and user feedback
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Plan proper fix with full testing
- [ ] Schedule regular deployment to replace emergency fix
- [ ] Review emergency procedures for improvements

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Monitoring

The deployment monitoring workflow checks:
- **Application responsiveness** (HTTP status checks)
- **API endpoint availability** 
- **Service health across all environments**
- **Deployment success rates and trends**

### Automated Alerts

Critical alerts are triggered for:
- **All services down** (critical system alert)
- **Production deployment failures** (immediate notification)
- **Emergency deployments** (audit notification)
- **Low deployment success rates** (<80% over 7 days)

### Monitoring Dashboard

Access real-time status via:
- GitHub Actions summary pages
- Deployment monitoring workflow results  
- Health check logs and history

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Tests not running" 
- **Cause**: Workflow trigger conditions not met
- **Solution**: Check file paths and branch configurations
- **Prevention**: Validate workflow triggers in pull requests

#### "Deployment blocked but tests passed"
- **Cause**: Timing issue or status check mismatch
- **Solution**: Re-run deployment workflow manually
- **Prevention**: Ensure status check names match exactly

#### "Emergency deployment not working"
- **Cause**: Missing approvals or environment configuration
- **Solution**: Check environment protection settings
- **Prevention**: Regularly test emergency procedures

#### "Health checks failing after deployment"
- **Cause**: Application startup issues or configuration problems
- **Solution**: Check application logs and server status
- **Prevention**: Validate configurations in staging first

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=test.yml --limit=10

# View specific workflow run
gh run view [RUN_ID] --log

# Check deployment status
gh run list --workflow="Deploy" --limit=5

# Verify branch protection rules
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection
```

- **Monthly**: Analyze trends and identify improvement opportunities
- **Quarterly**: Review and update procedures based on lessons learned

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop

1. **Monitor metrics** and gather team feedback
2. **Identify bottlenecks** in deployment process
3. **Implement improvements** to workflows and processes
4. **Document changes** and communicate to team
5. **Measure impact** of improvements

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- **Automated rollback** on health check failure
- **Canary deployments** for production releases
- **Integration testing** with external services
- **Performance regression testing** 
- **Slack/Teams notifications** for deployment events
