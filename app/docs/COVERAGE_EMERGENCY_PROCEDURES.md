# 🚨 Coverage Emergency Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for handling urgent situations where coverage thresholds cannot be met immediately, while maintaining accountability and ensuring follow-up.

## ⚠️ When to Use Emergency Bypass

Emergency coverage bypass should **ONLY** be used in these critical situations:

### ✅ Legitimate Emergency Scenarios
- **Security Hotfixes**: Critical security vulnerabilities requiring immediate deployment
- **Production Outages**: System-down situations requiring immediate fixes
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Urgent fixes to prevent data corruption or loss
- **Compliance Issues**: Regulatory or legal compliance requiring immediate action
- **Third-party Dependencies**: External service failures requiring workarounds

### ❌ NOT Valid Emergency Scenarios
- Feature deadlines or pressure
- Convenience or laziness
- "It's just a small change"
- Lack of time for proper testing
- CI/CD issues unrelated to coverage

## 🛠️ Emergency Bypass Procedures

### Step 1: Assess the Situation

Before using emergency bypass, verify:
1. **True Emergency**: Confirm this meets emergency criteria above
2. **Impact Assessment**: Document what will happen without immediate fix
3. **Risk Analysis**: Evaluate risks of deploying with lower coverage
4. **Timeline**: Estimate when proper coverage can be added

### Step 2: Get Approval

#### For Production Hotfixes
**Required Approvers** (at least 2):
- Technical Lead or Senior Developer
- Product Owner or Engineering Manager
- On-call Engineer (if applicable)

#### For Security Issues
**Required Approvers** (at least 2):
- Security Team Lead
- Technical Lead
- Engineering Manager

### Step 3: Activate Emergency Bypass

#### Local Development
```bash
# Run tests with emergency bypass
COVERAGE_EMERGENCY_BYPASS=true \
COVERAGE_BYPASS_APPROVER="John Doe, Jane Smith" \
COVERAGE_BYPASS_REASON="Critical security hotfix for CVE-2024-XXXX" \
COVERAGE_BYPASS_TICKET="SEC-123" \
npm run test:cov:check
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline
Set these environment variables in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: 🚨 Emergency Coverage Bypass
  if: env.EMERGENCY_COVERAGE_BYPASS == 'true'
  run: npm run test:cov:check
  env:
    COVERAGE_EMERGENCY_BYPASS: 'true'
    COVERAGE_BYPASS_APPROVER: 'John Doe, Jane Smith'
    COVERAGE_BYPASS_REASON: 'Critical security hotfix for CVE-2024-XXXX'
    COVERAGE_BYPASS_TICKET: 'SEC-123'
```

#### GitHub Actions Manual Trigger
For manual workflow dispatch, provide bypass parameters:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      emergency_bypass:
        description: 'Emergency coverage bypass'
        required: false
        default: 'false'
        type: boolean
      bypass_approver:
        description: 'Approver names (comma separated)'
        required: false
        type: string
      bypass_reason:
        description: 'Detailed reason for bypass'
        required: false
        type: string
      bypass_ticket:
        description: 'Ticket/issue number'
        required: false
        type: string
```

### Step 4: Execute and Document

1. **Deploy the Fix**: Use the bypass to deploy your emergency fix
2. **Create Follow-up Ticket**: Immediately create a high-priority ticket for coverage improvement
3. **Update Documentation**: Record the bypass in your incident log
4. **Notify Team**: Inform relevant stakeholders about the bypass

## 📊 Bypass Tracking and Reporting

### Automated Logging

Every bypass is automatically logged to `coverage-bypass.log`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00.000Z",
  "approver": "John Doe, Jane Smith",
  "reason": "Critical security hotfix for CVE-2024-XXXX",
  "ticket": "SEC-123",
  "commit": "abc123def456",
  "branch": "hotfix/security-patch"
}
```

### Monthly Reports

Generate monthly bypass reports:

```bash
# View bypass history
cat coverage-bypass.log | jq '.'

# Generate monthly summary
node scripts/generate-bypass-report.js --month 2024-01
```

### Metrics to Track

- Number of bypasses per month
- Time to remediation (bypass to coverage fix)
- Repeat offenders (files that frequently need bypass)
- Emergency types and patterns

## 🔄 Post-Emergency Process

### Immediate Actions (Within 24 Hours)
1. **Create Follow-up Ticket**: High priority, assigned to original developer
2. **Update Team**: Notify team of bypass usage and follow-up plan
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate if additional monitoring is needed

### Short-term Actions (Within 1 Week)
1. **Coverage Remediation**: Implement proper test coverage
2. **Code Review**: Ensure quality of both original fix and new tests
3. **Documentation Update**: Update any affected documentation

### Long-term Actions (Within 1 Month)
1. **Process Review**: Evaluate if bypass was necessary and justified
2. **Prevention Planning**: Identify ways to avoid similar situations
3. **Training**: Share learnings with team if applicable

## 🛡️ Preventing Bypass Abuse

### Monitoring and Alerts

- **Bypass Frequency**: Alert if bypasses exceed 2 per month
- **Remediation Delays**: Alert if follow-up tickets remain open > 1 week
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify files that frequently need bypasses

### Audit Process

#### Weekly Reviews
- Review all bypasses from the previous week
- Verify follow-up tickets are progressing
- Assess if bypasses were justified

#### Monthly Reviews
- Analyze bypass trends and patterns
- Update emergency procedures if needed
- Team retrospective on coverage practices

### Accountability Measures

- **Follow-up Tracking**: Monitor completion of remediation tickets
- **Performance Reviews**: Include coverage quality in developer evaluations
- **Code Review Requirements**: Extra scrutiny for files with bypass history

- Delayed remediation
- Repeat files requiring bypass
- Justification quality declining
