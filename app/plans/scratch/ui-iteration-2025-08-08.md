#### Mobile

- [ ] Sidebar: blue outline on second element only on startup
- [ ] Lesson when layout upside down: padding under prev lessons missing

- [ ] Repertoireitem drawer: end datum is startdatum
- [ ] Student drawer: add first and last name to card
- [ ] Update Group drawer: day when empty should not default to monday in select
- [ ] Switch buttons in delete repertoire item drawer
- [ ] Separator in create note modal
- [ ] Chech spacing create repertoire item
- [ ] Timetable increase margin bottom like it is
- [ ] Implement delete lesson
- [ ] Unify design mobile drawers: When from down, add close button with X icon. When from side add close button with Chevron left icon.
      If drawer contains forms or action buttons such as delete confirmation, add abort button. If drawer contains only information display and action buttons to open further drawers, dont implement or remove abort button.
- [ ] Make sure all buttons in all mobile drawers are full with, the abort button if existing should always be the last button.
- [ ] Consistent drawer design: Add Separator for mobile if not existing between information display and button group. Spacing should be handled by the Separator on mobile. A good example for this is the inactive holder drawer.
