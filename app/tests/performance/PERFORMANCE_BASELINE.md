## Performance Baselines

### 1. Page Load Performance

| Page | First Contentful Paint | Time to Interactive | DOM Content Loaded | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Dashboard | < 5,000ms | < 15,000ms | < 10,000ms | Initial application load |
| Lesson Planning | < 6,000ms | < 18,000ms | < 12,000ms | Complex form components |
| All Lessons | < 7,000ms | < 20,000ms | < 15,000ms | Data-heavy table view |
| Students | < 6,000ms | < 18,000ms | < 12,000ms | Student management interface |
| Settings | < 5,000ms | < 15,000ms | < 10,000ms | Simple configuration pages |

**Navigation Performance:**
- Average page-to-page navigation: < 5,000ms
- Acceptable range: 2,000ms - 8,000ms

### 2. Large Dataset Handling

| Dataset Size | Load Time | Table Render | Memory Usage | Performance Rating |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 100 Lessons | < 20,000ms | < 5,000ms | +20-40MB | Good |
| 500 Lessons | < 40,000ms | < 10,000ms | +50-100MB | Acceptable |
| 1000 Lessons | < 60,000ms | < 20,000ms | +100-200MB | Warning |

**Interactive Performance:**
- Pagination: < 5,000ms per page
- Search: < 3,000ms average response
- Sorting: < 5,000ms per operation

### 3. Memory Usage Patterns

| Scenario | Expected Usage | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Baseline (Dashboard) | 50-80MB | 100MB | 150MB |
| Navigation Growth | +10-30MB | +50MB | +80MB |
| Memory Leak Detection | +5MB per cycle | +8MB per cycle | +15MB per cycle |
| Large Dataset (1000) | +100-150MB | +200MB | +300MB |

**Memory Health Indicators:**
- ✅ Good: Memory growth < 20MB during normal usage
- ⚠️ Warning: Memory growth 20-50MB
- 🚨 Critical: Memory growth > 50MB or leak patterns detected

### 4. Bundle Size Analysis

| Asset Type | Current Size | Acceptable Threshold | Warning Threshold |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Total Bundle | 2-3MB | 5MB | 8MB |
| JavaScript | 1.5-2.5MB | 4MB | 6MB |
| CSS | 200-500KB | 1MB | 1.5MB |
| Individual JS Files | < 15 files | 20 files | 30 files |

**Code Splitting Effectiveness:**
- Route-specific resources: > 30% of total
- Shared resources: 40-60% of total
- Lazy loading: < 3,000ms per route

**Caching Performance:**
- Cache hit rate: > 70%
- Cached load speedup: > 1.5x
- Resource revalidation: < 500ms

## Performance Monitoring Recommendations

### 1. Continuous Monitoring
- Run performance tests weekly in CI/CD
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
- Track performance trends over time
- Alert on baseline degradation > 20%

### 2. Warning Indicators
Monitor for these performance regression signals:
- FCP increases > 2 seconds from baseline
- Memory growth > 30MB during normal usage
- Bundle size increases > 1MB without feature justification
- Cache effectiveness drops < 50%

### 3. Optimization Triggers
Consider optimization when:
- Any baseline exceeds warning threshold
- Memory leaks detected (consistent growth > 5MB per cycle)
- Large dataset performance degrades > 50%
- Bundle size grows > 20% without corresponding features

## Test Coverage

### Current Test Suite Includes:
- ✅ Page load performance (6 tests)
- ✅ Large dataset handling (5 tests) 
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring (5 tests)
- ✅ Bundle size impact analysis (4 tests)

**Total Performance Tests: 20**

### Future Enhancements
Consider adding tests for:
- Network throttling scenarios
- Mobile device performance
- Performance under high user load
- Database query performance impact
- Third-party service response time impact

## Baseline Evolution

### Version 2.4.1 (Initial Baseline - 2025-08-11)
- Established initial performance baselines
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Documented current performance characteristics
- Set up monitoring infrastructure

### Future Versions
Update this document when:
- Application undergoes major architectural changes
- Performance optimizations are implemented
- New features significantly impact performance
- Browser or dependency updates affect performance

## Performance Budget

### Recommended Performance Budget:
- **Page Load Budget**: 80% of baseline thresholds
- **Memory Budget**: 70% of warning thresholds  
- **Bundle Budget**: 75% of warning thresholds
- **Interactive Budget**: 90% of baseline expectations

### Enforcement Strategy:
1. **CI/CD Gates**: Fail builds that exceed performance budgets
2. **Performance Reviews**: Require performance analysis for large features
3. **Regular Audits**: Monthly performance baseline reviews
4. **User Monitoring**: Track real user performance metrics

## Tools and Infrastructure

### Performance Testing Stack:
- **Playwright**: End-to-end performance testing
