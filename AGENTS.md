This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üö® MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION UPDATE PROTOCOL üö®

**BEFORE REPORTING COMPLETION OF ANY AGENT OS WORK**: You MUST update ALL relevant documentation files:

1. **`.agent-os/specs/[spec-name]/progress.md`** - Mark tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETED, update metrics
2. **`.agent-os/specs/[spec-name]/implementation-plan.md`** - Update phase status, actual vs estimated time  
3. **`.agent-os/specs/[spec-name]/README.md`** - Update status, metrics table, next steps
4. **`.agent-os/specs/[spec-name]/decisions.md`** - Document any new technical decisions made

**This applies to**: Task completion, phase completion, major achievements, strategic decisions, problem resolutions

‚ùå **DO NOT** report work as complete until documentation is updated
‚úÖ **DO** update documentation immediately after completing work, before reporting to user

## Agent OS Integration

This project uses Agent OS for structured product development. Key documentation:

- **Product Overview**: `.agent-os/product/mission.md` - Core product mission and features
- **Roadmap**: `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` - 6-phase development plan with current progress
- **Tech Decisions**: `.agent-os/product/decisions.md` - Architectural and product decisions log
- **Tech Stack**: `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md` - Complete technical architecture
- **Specifications**: `.agent-os/specs/` - Feature specifications and requirements

When working on any code changes (features, bug fixes, improvements, refactoring), always reference the Agent OS documentation to understand:

- Product context and user workflows
- Established architectural patterns and constraints
- Current development priorities and phase
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- How changes fit into the overall product vision

### üìù Detailed Documentation Standards

When updating documentation (as required above), follow these standards:

- **Status Indicators**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED, üü° READY, ‚è≥ PENDING
- **Time Tracking**: Include actual time spent vs. estimates
- **Learning Documentation**: Document lessons learned and efficiency gains  
- **Metrics**: Update with real data (test counts, coverage, etc.)
- **Readiness**: Maintain phase readiness assessments

This ensures all Agent OS specifications remain current and accurate for future reference and continuation by any team member.

## Application Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite build tool
- **UI**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS, custom design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state, React Context for client state
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with nested routing structure
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with generated TypeScript types
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Payments**: Stripe integration with subscription management
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for iOS app deployment

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Context Providers**: The app uses multiple context providers for state management:

- `DataProvider`: Coordinates loading states across all queries
- `AuthProvider`: Manages user authentication
- `SubscriptionProvider`: Handles subscription state
- `DarkModeProvider`: Theme management
- `LoadingProvider`: Global loading state

**Query Management**: Uses TanStack Query extensively with custom hooks:

- Each feature has its own `*Query.ts` file for data fetching
- Mutations use custom hooks like `useCreateStudent`, `useUpdateLesson`
- Loading states are centralized in `DataProvider`

**Component Organization**:

- Feature components in `components/features/` organized by domain
- Each feature typically has CRUD operations, queries, and table components
- UI components in `components/ui/` follow shadcn/ui patterns
- Mobile-responsive with separate mobile components where needed

**Routing Structure**: Nested routing with feature-specific routers:

- `mainRouter.tsx` - Main application routes
- `lessonsRouter.tsx` - Lesson-related routes
- `studentsRouter.tsx` - Student management routes

### Key Features

- **Student Management**: CRUD operations with active/inactive states
- **Lesson Planning**: Create lessons, assign to students/groups, homework sharing
- **Notes System**: Color-coded notes with drag-and-drop ordering
- **Repertoire Management**: Track musical pieces and progress
- **Timetable**: Schedule management for lessons
- **Subscription Management**: Stripe integration with multiple plan types
- **PDF Export**: Generate PDFs for various data (student lists, repertoire, etc.)
- **Progressive Web App**: PWA capabilities with offline support

### Database Schema

Uses Supabase with TypeScript types generated from the schema. Key tables include:

- `students`, `groups` - Student and group management
- `lessons` - Lesson planning and history
- `notes` - User notes with ordering
- `repertoire` - Musical repertoire tracking
- `todos` - Task management
- `messages` - In-app messaging system

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for component and utility testing
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright with comprehensive subscription flow testing
- **Test Organization**: Tests organized by feature with shared utilities
- **CI/CD**: Tests run in CI with retry logic for flaky tests

### Mobile Considerations

- Uses Capacitor for iOS deployment
- Responsive design with mobile-specific components
- Touch-friendly interactions and mobile navigation patterns

## Visual Testing with Claude Code

### Authentication Setup

For visual testing and screenshot comparisons, test credentials are stored as environment variables:

- **Test Email**: Use `ELENO_TEST_EMAIL` environment variable (stored in `.env`)
- **Test Password**: Use `ELENO_TEST_PASSWORD` environment variable (stored in `.env`)
- **Test Account**: Dedicated account with sample data for testing purposes

### Playwright Authentication

To perform authenticated visual testing:

1. **Login Flow**: Use the environment variables to log into the application
2. **Auth State Storage**: Save authentication state to avoid repeated logins:
   ```typescript
   // Save auth state after first login
   await context.storageState({ path: 'playwright/auth-state.json' });
   
   // Reuse auth state in subsequent tests
   const context = await browser.newContext({ 
     storageState: 'playwright/auth-state.json' 
   });
   ```

### Visual Testing Commands

- `npm run pw:visual` - Run visual regression tests (if configured)
- Use Playwright's built-in screenshot capabilities for visual comparisons
- Screenshots are stored in `playwright/test-results/` and compared against baselines

### Best Practices

- Use consistent viewport sizes for screenshots
- Ensure stable test data in the test account
- Handle dynamic content (timestamps, IDs) appropriately
- Update visual baselines when UI changes are intentional


- Everything frontend related is in /app, everything server related thats not related to supabase is in /api
