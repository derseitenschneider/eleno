5. **Accessibility**: Complete ARIA labeling for all interactive elements

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Cross-browser Testing**: Test on Safari, Firefox, Edge
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with larger datasets (100+ students)
3. **Stress Testing**: Test concurrent user scenarios
4. **Security Testing**: Validate input sanitization and XSS protection

## Conclusion
The Eleno application demonstrates solid functionality across all major features. The UI is responsive and well-designed for both desktop and mobile use.
