```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup

The monitoring system is automatically configured with your existing GitHub Actions. No additional setup required for basic functionality.

### 2. Collect Your First Metrics

```bash
# Collect current test metrics
node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js collect

# Generate visual dashboard
node scripts/test-dashboard-generator.js generate

# Open dashboard in browser
open .test-metrics/dashboard/index.html
```

### 3. View Dashboard

The dashboard provides real-time insights into:
- Current coverage percentages
- Test pass rates and failure trends
- Build size and performance metrics
- Active alerts and recommendations

## 📊 Core Components

### 1. Metrics Collector (`test-metrics-collector.js`)

Collects and stores test metrics from various sources:

```bash
# Available commands
node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js collect    # Collect current metrics
node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js trends     # Calculate trend analysis
node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js alerts     # Detect and report alerts
node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js summary    # Generate CI summary
node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js history    # View historical data
```

**Data Sources:**
- Vitest coverage reports (`coverage/coverage-summary.json`)
- Playwright test results (`test-results/results.json`) 
- Build artifacts (`dist/` folder size)
- Git information (commit, branch, author)
- CI/CD environment data

### 2. Alerting System (`test-alerting-system.js`)

Monitors for issues and sends notifications:

```bash

node scripts/test-alerting-system.js notify    # Send notifications
node scripts/test-alerting-system.js summary   # Generate alert summary
```

**Alert Types:**
- **Coverage Drops**: Statement coverage < 80%, drops > 5%

    - cron: '0 8 1 * *'  # Monthly on 1st day 8 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      report_type:
        description: 'Report type'
        required: true
        default: 'week'
        type: choice
        options:
          - week
          - month

jobs:
  monitoring:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: 📊 Generate Reports
        run: |
          node scripts/test-reporting-automation.js generate ${{ inputs.report_type || 'week' }}
          
      - name: 📈 Performance Analysis
        run: |
          node scripts/performance-monitor.js recommendations
          
      - name: 📤 Upload Reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: monitoring-reports-${{ github.run_id }}
          path: .test-metrics/reports/
```

## 📋 Daily Operations

### For Developers

**Daily Workflow:**
1. Check dashboard for current test health: `open .test-metrics/dashboard/index.html`
2. Monitor alerts: `node scripts/test-alerting-system.js summary`
3. Review performance: `node scripts/performance-monitor.js report`

**When Tests Fail:**
1. Check specific failure details in GitHub Actions
2. Review dashboard for trends and patterns
3. Check if it's part of a larger regression pattern

### For Team Leads

**Weekly Review:**
1. Generate weekly report: `node scripts/test-reporting-automation.js generate week`
2. Review quality score trends
3. Address any high-priority alerts or regressions

**Monthly Analysis:**
1. Generate monthly report: `node scripts/test-reporting-automation.js generate month`
2. Review optimization recommendations
3. Plan improvement initiatives based on trends

### For DevOps/CI Maintainers

**Monitoring Health:**
1. Verify metrics collection is working: `node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js history`
2. Check notification channels are functioning
3. Monitor disk usage in `.test-metrics/` directory

**Performance Optimization:**
1. Run performance benchmarks: `node scripts/performance-monitor.js benchmark`
2. Review regression reports: `node scripts/performance-monitor.js regressions`  
3. Implement optimization recommendations

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. No Metrics Data**

```bash
# Check if coverage data exists
ls -la coverage/coverage-summary.json

# Check if Playwright results exist  
ls -la test-results/results.json

# Manually collect metrics
node scripts/test-metrics-collector.js collect
```

**2. Dashboard Not Updating**

```bash
# Regenerate dashboard
node scripts/test-dashboard-generator.js generate

# Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
# Ensure metrics data is present
```

**3. Alerts Not Triggering**

```bash
# Test alert detection
node scripts/test-alerting-system.js check

# Check environment variables
echo $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Test notifications manually
node scripts/test-alerting-system.js notify
```

**4. Performance Monitoring Issues**

```bash
# Run manual benchmark
node scripts/performance-monitor.js benchmark

# Check system resources
node scripts/performance-monitor.js report | grep "System Information"
```

### Data Cleanup

Clean up old data to prevent disk usage issues:

```bash
# Remove metrics older than 90 days (manual cleanup)
find .test-metrics -name "*.json" -mtime +90 -delete

# The system automatically keeps only the last 100 metrics entries
# and 50 performance benchmarks to prevent unlimited growth
```

## 📊 Metrics Reference

### Quality Score Calculation

The quality score (0-100) is calculated based on:

- **Coverage Factor (40%)**: Average of statements, branches, functions, lines
  - 90%+ coverage: No penalty
  - 80-90% coverage: -5 points  
  - 70-80% coverage: -10 points
  - <70% coverage: -20 points

- **Test Reliability (30%)**: Average pass rate
  - 99%+ pass rate: No penalty
  - 95-99% pass rate: -5 points
  - 80-95% pass rate: -10 points  
  - <80% pass rate: -20 points

- **Performance Factor (20%)**: Build time and bundle size trends
  - Slower builds: -10 points
  - Larger bundles: -5 points

- **Alert Penalty (10%)**: Active alerts
  - High severity: -10 points each
  - Medium severity: -5 points each

### Trend Analysis

Trends are calculated by comparing the first half and second half of recent data points:

- **Improving**: >2% improvement for coverage, >5% for pass rates
- **Declining**: >2% decrease for coverage, >5% for pass rates  
- **Stable**: Changes within normal variation

### Performance Regression Detection

Regressions are detected when metrics increase beyond thresholds:

- **Build Time**: >20% increase
- **Test Duration**: >25% increase
- **Bundle Size**: >10% increase
