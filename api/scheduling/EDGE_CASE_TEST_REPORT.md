## Conclusion

The scheduling algorithm demonstrates robust performance across a comprehensive range of edge cases, with a 91.1% pass rate and consistent sub-second solve times. While the enhanced algorithm provides additional metrics and multiple solving strategies, it doesn't improve core scheduling performance significantly.

The algorithm is **production-ready** with the following caveats:
- Monitor performance on nested availability scenarios
- Consider implementing priority-based scheduling for fairness
- Add user feedback mechanisms for impossible scheduling scenarios

The edge case testing framework provides a solid foundation for ongoing algorithm development and regression testing as the system scales to handle more complex real-world scheduling requirements.
