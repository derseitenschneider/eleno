# Lesson Absence Recording System Specification

**Created**: 2025-08-25  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-25  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Planning  
**Priority**: High (Phase 1 Roadmap Feature)  
**Estimated Duration**: 8 days  

## Overview

The Lesson Absence Recording System allows teachers to mark lessons as "held," "student absent," or "teacher absent." When marking a lesson as an absence, the standard lesson content and homework editors are replaced with a single text field for recording the reason for the absence.

This feature addresses a core requirement in the Eleno roadmap (Phase 1: Absence Recording) and provides teachers with complete lesson management capabilities.

## Objectives

**Primary Objective**: Implement comprehensive absence tracking for lessons while maintaining the existing lesson planning workflow.

**Success Criteria**:
- Teachers can mark lessons with three status types: held, student absent, teacher absent
- Conditional UI displays appropriate fields based on absence status
- Absence reasons are captured and stored when applicable
- Existing lesson planning functionality remains unchanged
- Database migrations are seamless and backward-compatible

## User Stories

### Story 1: Record Student Absence
**As a teacher**, I want to mark a lesson as "student absent" and record the reason, so I can track attendance patterns and communicate with parents.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Select "SchÃ¼lerabsenz" from a dropdown next to the date picker
- Standard lesson content and homework fields are hidden
- Single text area appears for absence reason
- Absence reason is required when status is "student absent"
- Lesson is saved with absence information

### Story 2: Record Teacher Absence
**As a teacher**, I want to mark a lesson as "teacher absent" and record the reason, so I can maintain accurate lesson records.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Select "Lehrerabsenz" from a dropdown next to the date picker
- Standard lesson content and homework fields are hidden
- Single text area appears for absence reason
- Absence reason is required when status is "teacher absent"
- Lesson is saved with absence information

### Story 3: Record Held Lesson
**As a teacher**, I want to mark a lesson as "held" (default), so I can document lesson content and homework as usual.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Stattgefunden" is selected by default in the dropdown
- Standard WYSIWYG editors for lesson content and homework are displayed
- Lesson content or homework is required (existing validation)
- Absence reason field is not displayed and is cleared if previously set

### Story 4: Change Lesson Status
**As a teacher**, I want to change a lesson's status after initial creation, so I can correct mistakes or update information.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can change status via lesson edit functionality
- UI adapts to show appropriate fields based on new status
- Data validation applies based on new status
- Previous data is handled appropriately (cleared when switching contexts)

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Changes

The implementation will add new fields to the existing `lessons` table without modifying the current `status` column (which tracks 'documented'/'prepared' states).

**New Database Objects**:

1. **ENUM Type**: `absence_type`
   ```sql
   CREATE TYPE absence_type AS ENUM ('held', 'student_absent', 'teacher_absent');
   ```

2. **New Columns on `lessons` table**:
   - `lesson_type` (absence_type ENUM, DEFAULT 'held', NOT NULL)
   - `absence_reason` (text, NULLABLE)

**Migration Strategy**:
- Use Supabase MCP for all database changes
- Create migration script with proper rollback procedures
- Default all existing lessons to 'held' status
- Update RLS policies if necessary

### Type System Updates

**Generated Types**:
- Run `npm run generate-types:prod` after database migration
- Supabase types will automatically include new fields

**Custom Types** (in `src/types/types.ts`):
- Extend existing `Lesson` type to include `lesson_type` and `absence_reason`
- Update `LessonPartial` type for creation operations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing type usage

### API Layer

**Supabase Direct Integration**:
- Update `createLessonAPI` in `app/src/services/api/lessons.api.ts`
- Update `updateLessonAPI` for status transitions
- Add validation logic for status-dependent fields

**Validation Rules**:
- If `lesson_type` is 'student_absent' or 'teacher_absent': `absence_reason` required
- If `lesson_type` is 'held': `lessonContent` or `homework` required, `absence_reason` cleared
- Status transitions handle data cleanup appropriately

### Frontend Implementation

**Component Updates**:

1. **CreateLessonForm Component**:
   - Add Shadcn Select component next to DatePicker
   - Implement conditional rendering based on `lesson_type`
   - Update form validation schema (Zod)

2. **Form Integration**:
   - Use react-hook-form Controller for Select component
   - Update form state management
   - Handle status change events

3. **Conditional UI**:
   - Show WYSIWYG editors when `lesson_type === 'held'`
   - Show Textarea for absence reason when status is absent
   - Smooth transitions between UI states

**TanStack Query Integration**:

1. **Query Hooks**:
   - Update `useLessonsQuery` to select new columns
   - Ensure proper data transformation

2. **Mutation Hooks**:
   - Update `useCreateLesson` to handle new fields
   - Update `useUpdateLesson` for status transitions
   - Add optimistic updates for better UX

## Data Flow

### Lesson Creation Flow

1. **User selects lesson status** from dropdown (defaults to 'held')
2. **UI renders appropriate fields** based on status selection
3. **User fills required fields** (content/homework OR absence reason)
4. **Form validation** ensures required fields are complete
5. **API call** creates lesson with appropriate fields
6. **Database stores** lesson with status and relevant content
7. **UI updates** with success feedback and resets form

### Lesson Update Flow

1. **User opens existing lesson** for editing
2. **Form pre-populates** with current status and content
3. **User can change status** via dropdown
4. **UI adapts** to show appropriate fields for new status
5. **Data cleanup** occurs when switching between status types
6. **Validation** ensures new requirements are met
7. **API call** updates lesson with new data
8. **Cache invalidation** ensures UI reflects changes

## Validation Rules

### Form Validation (Zod Schema)

```typescript
const lessonSchema = z.object({
  lesson_type: z.enum(['held', 'student_absent', 'teacher_absent']),
  lessonContent: z.string().optional(),
  homework: z.string().optional(),
  absence_reason: z.string().optional(),
  // ... other fields
}).refine((data) => {
  if (data.lesson_type === 'held') {
    return data.lessonContent || data.homework; // At least one required
  } else {
    return data.absence_reason; // Required for absences
  }
}, {
  message: "Required fields must be filled based on lesson status"
});
```

### API Validation

- Server-side validation mirrors client-side rules
- Reject requests with invalid field combinations
- Clear inappropriate fields during status transitions

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- Existing RLS policies on `lessons` table will automatically cover new columns
- Verify authenticated user can only access their own lesson data
- No additional security changes required

### Data Privacy
