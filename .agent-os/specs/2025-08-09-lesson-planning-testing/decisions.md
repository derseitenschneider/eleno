## Decision Log

### Decision #001: Testing Framework Selection
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Status**: ✅ Decided  
**Context**: Need to choose primary unit/integration testing framework

**Options Considered**:
1. **Vitest** (chosen)
2. Jest
3. Node Test Runner

**Decision**: Use Vitest as the primary testing framework

**Rationale**:

- Integrates well with existing E2E test structure

**Metrics to Track**:
- Page load time for lessons page
- Time to interactive for lesson creation form
- Large dataset rendering performance (50+ lessons)
- Memory usage during lesson operations

**Implications**:
